# File usage:
- common_processing: for common functions used for processing with the spectrum
- label_dict: dictionary of labels
- models: constructing models
- Split training datas: copy raw data in a folder with all data using for training
- Test train model: to test the trained model
- Training data generator: generate and validating data for training
- training: start the training procedure

# Done tasks:
- Normalize input data
- Preform classification on 1st deriatve
- Upgrade classify model, better performance
- Smoothed input data, standar scaled
- Training on 3 layers: raw spectrum, 1st der and 2nd der

# Todo:
- Get one-shot learning model ready
